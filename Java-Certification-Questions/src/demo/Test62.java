public class Test62 {
//    A.java: Contains a valid public class definition. This will compile successfully.
//    B.java: Defines a private method (doStuff()) with a private variable x. However, as there are no syntax issues, this file will also compile successfully.
//    C.java: Declares a package pl and attempts to define another public class A. Java restricts multiple public classes in separate files under the same package. Therefore, this file will not compile.
